            <span>What is puppy cube?</span><br/>
            It's a standalone and all-in-one ultra short-throw touchscreen projector with Android.


            <br/><br/><br/><span>Can I download more apps to it?</span><br/>
            You can download any app that you would normally use on an Android tablet. The app store we use is called Uptodown, which is the biggest alternative app store to Google Play.


            <br/><br/><br/><span>So it works like a regular tablet?</span><br/>
            Yes, thanks to our proprietary AnyTouch technology the screen works like any other capacitive touchscreen. This means that most apps will work as if you're using a regular tablet device.


            <br/><br/><br/><span>So what can I actually do with it?</span><br/>
            You can use it by itself as a 23-inch tablet on any flat surface. You can connect it to your phone, PC or gaming console and use it as a regular short-throw projector. You can use it as a Bluetooth speaker, a video conferencing tool and many other things. The possibilities are endless!


            <br/><br/><br/><span>Can I connect it to my phone/tablet/computer/gaming console etc?</span><br/>
            Yes! You can connect it with a cable by using the HDMI port, or wirelessly via AirPlay, Miracast or DLNA.


            <br/><br/><br/><span>Can it turn any device into a touchscreen?</span><br/>
            If you connect a device to it, puppy cube will become an external screen only. The touch functionality doesn't work together with other devices.


            <br/><br/><br/><span>Can I use the touchscreen in the horizontal projection mode?</span><br/>
            Yes! As long as you put it next to the wall. The touchscreen is calibrated to be used with the 23-inch screen size.


            <br/><br/><br/><span>How long is the battery life? How long does it take to charge?</span><br/>
            When not plugged in, you can use it for 2.5 hours on a single charge. Charging time is less than three hours.


            <br/><br/><br/><span>Is it still a touchscreen at 100 inches?</span><br/>
            No the projection is not a touchscreen at 100 inches.


            <br/><br/><br/><span>Can the screen be bigger in the vertical projection mode?</span><br/>
            When using puppy cube in the vertical projection mode the screen size is fixed at 23 inches.


            <br/><br/><br/><span>What’s the lifespan of the projector bulb?</span><br/>
            20,000 hours, or roughly 10 years of normal use.


            <br/><br/><br/><span>How did you make it into a touchscreen?</span><br/>
            There’s a camera that constantly tracks and reads your fingers. Via autofocus it can detect a tap on the surface with virtually no delay.
